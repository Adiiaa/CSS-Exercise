        <p>Welcome to Split Space, 
            where we believe that sharing the cost of housing should be simple, transparent, and beneficial for everyone involved. Our mission is to create a platform that brings individuals together to collaboratively share the expenses of comfortable living spaces, fostering a sense of community and financial ease.

            <p>At Split Space, we envision a future where the burden of housing costs is lightened through shared responsibility. We aim to create a network of like-minded individuals who recognize the value of cooperative living and the positive impact it can have on both their wallets and overall well-being.
